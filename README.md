# Telegraph Bounties

<img src="assets/social-preview.png" alt="Telegraph Bounties — Build the missing pieces of the machine-intelligence market" width="100%">

## The public work board for the Telegraph network.

Telegraph is a peer-to-peer ranking protocol for machine intelligence. This repository lists **what the network is missing** (a Provider, an Evaluator, an app, evaluation material, an integration) so builders can pick a gap, fix it and show proof.

> **Gap found → public Issue → builder claims → builds → submits proof → maintainer verifies → capability gets stronger.**

Each Issue states its reward status. **At launch, every bounty is unfunded.** Future funded rewards will publish the amount, asset and rules before claims open.

This repository contains the public contribution board and its tooling. Report vulnerabilities through the private channel in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## What can be built

Every gap on the board is one of these:

| Gap | What it means | Label |
|---|---|---|
| **Miner / Provider** | Missing, weak or unreliable intelligence supply for an Intent | `work:miner` |
| **Evaluator: adapter** | Missing or weak scoring logic (a Category-level WASM adapter) | `work:evaluator` |
| **Evaluator: material** | Missing or stale test material and independently supported references | `work:evaluator` |
| **App / Agent / integration** | An application that cannot finish its workflow because something is missing | `work:app` |
| **Tooling / protocol** | SDKs, examples, docs, observability, reliability | `work:tooling`, `work:protocol` |
| **Security hardening** | Public, non-sensitive hardening of this repository's tooling | `work:security` |
| **Release coverage** | A major AI release that the network cannot yet measure fairly | `source:release` |

Miners and Evaluators work **per Intent**, independent of industry. Apps work **per mission**. One good contribution can unblock several apps at once.

## How a bounty works

1. **Pick** an Issue labelled `status:open`.
2. **Read** the acceptance criteria and the `## Reward` section before writing code.
3. **Claim** it by commenting `/claim`. One claimant per Issue.
4. **Build** the smallest thing that meets the criteria. Post `/progress <update>` at least every 72 hours or the claim is released.
5. **Submit** proof with `/submit <links and evidence>`.
6. A maintainer reproduces your result, then runs `/approve` or returns it with `/changes <reason>`.

A bounty is complete when its acceptance criteria are **reproducibly met**. Protocol eligibility remains a separate network decision. Details: [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

Provider recruitment listings (`opportunity:provider`) are for established services exploring onboarding. Their commercial process runs outside the bounty claim workflow.

## Explore from the command line

The catalogue commands need only Python 3 and no network. On Windows use `tb.cmd` instead of `./tb`.

```bash
./tb map                          # missions and their Intents
./tb mission exchange             # one mission's Intents
./tb intent SANCTIONS_SCREENING_MATCH
./tb search weather
```

Live board commands need the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) signed in (`gh auth login`):

```bash
./tb next                         # open claimable bounties, P0 first
./tb claim 42
./tb progress 42 "Provider is live; wiring the reference request set now."
./tb submit 42 "https://github.com/you/project: live demo + request IDs in README"
```

## Rewards

A funded Issue defines the amount, denomination, payout asset, conversion rule when needed, eligibility, verification condition and payout window. When you `/claim`, the bot records a visible snapshot and SHA-256 hash of those terms. Maintainers compare that record with the separate funding authorization before payout.

An unfunded Issue carries no payment commitment. See [docs/REWARDS.md](docs/REWARDS.md).

## Board boundaries

- Issues begin with real demand, an observed failure or a verified release gap.
- Public reports use authorized, sanitized evidence. [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) and [docs/DEMAND_INTAKE.md](docs/DEMAND_INTAKE.md) explain the private reporting paths.
- Each Issue states its funding status and acceptance criteria.
- GitHub coordinates contributions; Telegraph's production systems decide eligibility and rankings.

## For maintainers and operators

```bash
python scripts/prepush.py    # validate structure, data, docs and run all tests (what CI runs)
npm test                     # tests only
make seed-h2                 # publish only approved Season II seed items
make launch-check            # offline gate: refuses to pass with an empty board
```

Runbooks live in [docs/maintainers](docs/maintainers/README.md): triage, launch, GitHub settings and the evaluation pipeline. Announce the board after it contains approved, useful work.
